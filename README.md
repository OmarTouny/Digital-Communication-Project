# Quadrature Phase Shift keying Modulation

### QPSK can be stated as a method for transmitting digital information across an analog channel. Data bits are grouped into pairs, and each pair is represented by a particular waveform, called a symbol, to be sent across the channel after modulating the carrier. The most commonly used modulation scheme for wireless and cellular systems is Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK). It’s because it does not suffer from BER degradation while the band width efficiency is increased

## The modulation Schema contains: 
1.	The Random Integer Generator block, block generates uniformly distributed random integers in the range [0, M-1], where M is specified by the Set size parameter
2.	The QPSK Modulator Baseband block, to the right of the Integer Random Generator block, modulates the signal.
3. The Constellation Diagram block, displays a scatter plot of the signal without the added noise.
4.	The AWGN Channel block models a noisy channel by adding white Gaussian noise to the modulated signal.
5.	The Constellation Diagram block, displays a scatter plot of the signal with added noise.
6.	The QBSK Demodulator Baseband block Baseband block, to the right of the AGWN channel demodulates the signal.
7.	The Error Rate Calculation block counts symbols that differ between the received signal and the transmitted signal.

# Binary Phase Shift Keying Modulation

### Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) is a type of digital modulation technique in which we are sending one bit per symbol i.e., ‘0’ or a ‘1’. Hence, the bit rate and symbol rate are the same. Depending upon the message bit, we can have a phase shift of 0 or 180 degree with respect to a reference carrier.
